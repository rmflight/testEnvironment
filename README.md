# testEnvironment

I wanted a very simple package that demonstrated how to initialize and work with custom environments in `R` packages for storing package specific data that one does not visible to the user, or cluttering up the users workspace. This is a package for others to learn from as well, because I could not find this easily on the web. I'm sure Carl found this in other `R` packages, but I took it from his [`knitcitations` package](https://github.com/cboettig/knitcitations) (however, blame me for any errors you see here, not him)

If anyone knows a better way to do this type of thing, please let me know, or fork and submit a pull request.
